# Testing ExoBLAS

## Building ExoBLAS

We use CMake and its presets feature to ease configuration. There
are currently three presets, but `cmake --list-presets` will always
show the current list:

```
$ cmake --list-presets
Available configure presets:

  "apple-silicon" - Apple M1 or M2 mac
  "linux-arm64"   - Linux AArch64
  "avx2"          - Intel AVX2
  "avx512"        - Intel AVX512
```

For example, to use `avx2`, you can setup a build directory using:

```
cmake --preset avx2
```
You can build the whole library with tests using:
```
cmake --build build/avx2
```

If you want to compile an individual target you can run:
```
cmake --build build/avx2 exo_[KERNEL] # to build the binary for this kernel
cmake --build build/avx2 [KERNEL]_correctness # to build the correctness test for this kernel
cmake --build build/avx2 [KERNEL]_bench # to build the bench test for this kernel
```
If you want to benchmark against a new library, you need to run:
```
cmake --preset avx2 -DBLA_VENDOR=[OTHER_LIB]
```
Then, recompile the benchmark test:
```
cmake --build build/avx2 [KERNEL]_bench
```

## Running the correctness tests
To run the correctness test for all kernels:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R correctness
```
To run the correctness for an individual kernel:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R [KERNEL]_correctness
```

## Running the benchmark tests
To run the benchmark test for all kernels:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R bench
```
To run the benchmark for an individual kernel:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R [KERNEL]_bench
```
To run the benchmark for ExoBLAS only:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R exo_[KERNEL]_bench # Run ExoBLAS benchmark for [KERNEL]
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R exo_ # Run ExoBLAS benchmark for all kernels
```
To run the benchmark for the reference BLAS library only:
```
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R cblas_[KERNEL]_bench # Run reference benchmark for [KERNEL]
ctest --test-dir ./build/avx2 -V -R cblas_ # Run the reference benchmark for all kernels
```
Note that benchmark results are cached, so you can run the reference benchmarks once when you start development. Remember to rerun them if you change the inputs being passed by the benchmark.

## Running the graphing script
To plot one kernel results, you can run:
```
python analytics_tools/graphing/graph.py [KERNEL]
```
To plot summary results for all kernels, you can run:
```
python analytics_tools/graphing/graph.py all
```
You will be able to find the results in:
```
python analytics_tools/graphing/graphs
```

## Lines of code summary
To get a summary of the lines of code in `src/`, you can run:
```
python analytics_tools/loc/count_loc.py
```
